<h1>1. Generalities of the  Terms of Service </h1>
<p>Welcome to <strong>TAKKi Dynamics (Pty) LTD</strong>!  (a.k.a. &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or the &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot;).  We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following  terms and conditions (collectively, these &quot;<strong>Terms of Service</strong>&quot;)  apply to your use of mytakki.com, including any content, functionality and  services offered on or via mytakki.com (the &quot;<strong>Website</strong>&quot;). The Terms of  Service also include our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, that you can review our  website.<br />
  We want to keep our relationship with you as  lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully  before you start using TAKKi Dynamics (Pty) LTD, because <strong>by using the Website  you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service</strong>.<br />
  Should you disagree with some of the provisions  herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you  go!), or contact us at official email address reachable from the Website. In  any case, we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.</p>
<h2>2.  Changes and Modifications </h2>

We reserve the right to update the Website and these  Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to  announce any major change in a prominent way, but since &quot;major&quot; is a  very subjective concept, you can always monitor and subscribe to changes via  our TOS Tracker (yes, we track our own Terms!). Of course, this document is  public on TAKKi  Dynamics (Pty) LTD, and you will be able to see the changes for  any new version (just click on the &quot;See all versions&quot; button on the  right). <strong>Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of  updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</strong></p>
